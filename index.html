      <h2>Title, Summary and Team Members</h2>
      Team Members: Albert Xie, Jon Giller, Dhanin Wongpanich, Soren
      <br />Project Title: Dynamic Lighthouse and Coastal Waters
      <br />Description: We plan on creating a scene of a floating boat in water
      with waves and a nearby lighthouse. We aim to create a realistic
      wave/water simulation that interacts with the boat and shoreline. Our
      lighthouse will rotate, dynamically lighting the scene.

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      Water physics and graphics are a well studied field of computer graphics,
      however they are often neglected in most simulations that we interact
      with. We are interested in how we can simulate water physics in a
      realistic but computationally efficient way. We plan to create a scene
      including a boat and a lighthouse along a shoreline to highlight our wave
      simulation with static and nonstatic objects. With our simulation, we aim
      to show the lighting conditions for a boat in the ocean at night and
      simulate the danger of nighttime maritime navigation. Simulating water
      realistically and interactions with both the shore and boat will be the
      most difficult portions of the project. We will explore the sum of sines,
      height field wave equations, and particle simulations for wave
      simulations. We aim to use ray tracing for the dynamic lighting from the
      lighthouse.

      <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
      <h3>Plan to deliver</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Dynamic light rotating from the lighthouse shining on the water and
          the boat (raytracing)
        </li>
        <li>Water splashing against the shore/boat (Water simulation)</li>
        <li>Water moving the boat (boat simulation)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Hope to deliver</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Moonlight shining (raytracing)</li>
        <li>Subsurface scattering of illuminated water</li>
        <li>Ripples behind the boat (water simulation)</li>
        <li>Buoyancy based simulation of boat physics</li>
        <li>Interactive demo where you can control the boat</li>
      </ol>
      We plan to deliver a video of the coastal scene, but hope to deliver an
      interactive demo. We plan to compare other simulations/games with water
      scenes to see how our quality compares.
