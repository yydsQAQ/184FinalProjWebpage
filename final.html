      <!-- ABSTRACT -->
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This project explored the development of a real-time dynamic ocean scene
        in Shadertoy, integrating a diverse range of graphics techniques. We
        implemented raymarching with Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) for
        complex geometry, investigated different approaches to buoyancy
        simulation, developed realistic procedural water rendering, implemented
        a 2.5D heightfield water simulation, and utilized procedural generation
        for atmospheric effects. Through this process, we gained significant
        practical understanding of these individual components and valuable
        experience in their complex integration. A major undertaking involved
        the challenging task of understanding, adapting, and correctly
        incorporating pre-existing SDF shaders for a boat and lighthouse into
        our custom shader. Tackling the water simulation using a heightfield
        approach proved particularly insightful, enhancing our knowledge of
        compute shaders and texture-based data management. We built everything
        ourselves except for the lighthouse and boat sdf. We also used ChatGPT
        to help debug, process, and understand code. It was a very helpful tool
        and made tackling this project much more approachable!
      </p>

      <!-- TECHNICAL APPROACH -->
      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

      <h3>Water Rendering</h3>
      <p>
        We render an animated ocean by combining procedural noise, ray marching,
        and view-dependent lighting. We shape the water surface by layering
        multiple animated wave patterns using cosine functions and directional
        noise, which gives our waves a natural and dynamic motion. To find where
        a camera ray intersects the water, we march forward step by step until
        we hit the ocean surface, then use binary search to refine that point.
        At the hit point, we estimate the surface normal by sampling nearby
        positions, which helps us apply lighting and reflections accurately. We
        blend a base blue-green water color with specular highlights from a
        directional light source, using a Fresnel-style effect to make
        reflections stronger at shallow viewing angles.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Raymarching & SDFs: Boat, Lighthouse & Other Boat/Lighthouse Effects
      </h3>
      <h4>Raymarching</h4>
      <p>
        To understand the ideas behind generating the scene in this project, we
        must discuss Raymarching and Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). The idea
        behind raymarching is an alternative to BVH trees/polygon meshes with a
        different implementation, which will be needed to render large and
        complex objects (that are not easily described using polygon meshes)
        such as boats and lighthouses. Like with traditional ray tracing, you
        have a ray with a direction rd and origin ro. The traditional
        raymarching loop goes as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code>float raymarch(vec3 ro, vec3 rd) {
    float t = 0.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        vec3 p = ro + rd * t;
        float d = map(p);
        if (d < 0.001) break;
        t += d;
        if (t > 100.0) break;
     }
    return t;
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This loop begins at the origin. The map function calculates the minimum
        distance to any of the objects described with SDFs (which I will explain
        soon). The ray can safely be progressed that much further. This loop
        continues until either the distance to the nearest object is minimal
        (less than 0.001 here), so the ray intersects this object, or the
        distance from the origin is too far and no more iterations will occur,
        meaning the ray did not intersect any objects.
      </p>

      <h4>SDFs</h4>
      <p>
        Moving onto SDFs, how does the map function know where the nearest
        object is? Well, using SDFs, functions that describe shapes using
        mathematical formulas, this is calculated using the distance from the
        current point on the raymarching loop to the origin of the shape. For
        example, the SDF for a simple sphere is as follows:
      </p>

      <pre><code>float sdSphere(vec3 p, float r) {
    return length(p) - r;
}
</code></pre>

      <p>
        where p is the vector from the origin of the sphere to the point
        currently assessed in raymarching. Below are several examples of
        raymarching being used to render spheres showing a simple sphere, then
        two spheres, one behind the other (showing how we can render multiple
        objects and put the closer one over the other since the intersection
        occurs first), and finally a bunch of spheres using a relatively simple
        iterative algorithm.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h4>Boat and Lighthouse SDFs</h4>
      <p>
        Building the boat and lighthouse from SDFs would be entire projects in
        themselves, which was not the goal of our project, so we implemented
        these from other shaders, linked in the references section and seen
        below.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img
          src="img/2.gif"
          style="display: inline-block; width: 300px"
          alt="img/index.png"
        />
        <img
          src="img/3.gif"
          style="display: inline-block; width: 300px"
          alt="img/index.png"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Implementing these into our shader with the accurate water simulation
        was quite the challenge due to the convoluted and confusing codebase
        left by the creators. It took a lot of trial and error to implement
        these into our shader, but understanding the basics of raymarching and
        SDFs helped immensely.
      </p>

      <h4>Boat and Lighthouse Other Effects</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to adding the boat, we were able to implement a feature
        where the sails would look like they were being inflated by the wind,
        pushing the boat in the direction of travel. This was an improvement to
        the plain boat SDF with the sails being flat sheets. We implemented this
        using the boat’s direction of travel and adding a small increment to the
        sails positions in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another effect that was quite challenging to add was using the
        lighthouse’s rendering function to implement lighting from the
        lighthouse’s light onto the ocean and the water. This allowed the light
        to shine onto the water’s surface as it rotated, as well as the boat,
        even shining into the camera as it rotated to capture the accurate
        rotation of a lighthouse tower light. We made this red to add more of an
        interesting color scheme since the one above was quite bland.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5D Water Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        We implemented a physically accurate water simulation utilizing a 2.5D
        height field approach. This method required storing the water height at
        specific UV coordinates within a compute buffer. Subsequently, in each
        simulation step, we applied the 2D Shallow Water equations, considering
        neighboring cells, to determine the water height for the next step.
        Initially, our implementation only sampled the four cardinal neighbors;
        however, we later included diagonal neighbors in the sampling process
        after observing square wave artifacts.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/4.png"
          alt="img/index.png"
          style="width: 500px; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Another challenge involved smoothly blending the 2.5D heightfield
        simulation with a sum-of-sines wave representation. As simulation points
        approached the boundary edge, we progressively blended in the value
        derived from the sum of sines. This blending was also applied visually,
        calculating a weighted average between the physically accurate
        simulation result and the sum-of-sines output. Furthermore, the
        initialization process required sampling initial heights from the height
        field data. We handled the transfer of this data using a method
        analogous to texture mapping, which necessitated converting between UV
        coordinates and the corresponding coordinates within the simulation
        space.
      </p>

      <h3>Buoyancy Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, we tried a simplified two-way coupling approach based on
        these physically based equations.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/5.png"
          alt="img/index.png"
          style="width: 500px; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        However, state management was difficult, and although we got preliminary
        results, it was difficult to work with and calculate normals correctly
        with a moving boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we applied a simpler, unique approach. We sample at 4 points:
        front, back, left, and right. We approximate the boat hull with a
        rectangle for 1 way coupling, where the water is pushed down by the
        rectangle sdf.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/6.png"
          alt="img/index.png"
          style="width: 400px; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        We use an Exponential Moving Average for all 4 points to calculate the
        position. We store these 4 points in the unused space of a magic pixel
        in the compute shader. This is used to render the boat and rocking based
        off of a normal vector calculated from the 4 points.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/7.png"
          alt="img/index.png"
          style="width: 400px; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>

      <h3>Circular movement</h3>
      <p>
        We define the boat's movement using the parametric equation for a
        circle. The boat's central XZ position is updated each frame based on
        this circular path equation. For the simulation, we calculate the
        'forward' direction as the tangent to the circle at the boat's current
        position. The sample points ('front', 'back', 'left', 'right') are then
        found by offsetting the center along this calculated forward direction
        and its perpendicular 'right' direction, using the boat's defined
        half-dimensions. The boat's current XZ location is stored between frames
        in a state pixel. To render the boat, its orientation, including
        rocking, is determined using an 'up' vector derived from the smoothed
        heights at these four points (read from state pixels), combined with the
        path's tangent direction.
      </p>

      <h3>Sky & Clouds</h3>
      <p>
        We implemented clouds and sky gradient using a combination of fractal
        Brownian motion (FBM), Perlin-style noise, and rotation matrices to add
        variation. The FBM function combines multiple octaves of smoothed noise
        to simulate the soft, layered look of real clouds. I blended this with a
        dynamic sky gradient that transitions from sunset tones near the horizon
        to darker blue tones at the top, simulating twilight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, the clouds looked flat and artificial — too uniform, too
        “blobby,” and lacked depth.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/8.png"
          alt="img/index.png"
          style="width: 500px; height: auto"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>
        To improve realism, I increased the complexity of the FBM by adding more
        octaves and fine-tuning frequency and decay parameters, which taught me
        that multi-layered noise is essential for natural-looking clouds. I also
        applied rotation matrices within the FBM loop to break up axis-aligned
        patterns, learning that domain warping is key to avoiding repetitive
        artifacts. Additionally, I used ‘smoothstep’ and exponential falloff to
        blend the clouds with the sky gradient more naturally, which highlighted
        how critical smooth transitions and atmospheric light scattering are for
        realism. This process showed me that lighting, edge softness, and
        variation together create the illusion of depth and make procedural
        clouds feel convincing.
      </p>
